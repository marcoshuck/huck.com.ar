        <p class="text-body-1 text-center my-2">
          My main areas of expertise are backend technologies and distributed systems, but I also like to use frontend
          technologies to deliver a better experience to users. I'm a highly motivated person that loves to solve
          challenging problems, meet great people and find ways of creating a better world using technology.

          This website was created to introduce myself to you, and find how we can collaborate to
          solve challenging problems together.

          Welcome to my little space, and feel free to reach out through the <a>Contact</a> page. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
